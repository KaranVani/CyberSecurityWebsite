					<h2 class="titlez" load-hidden>The Importance Of Naming Files</h2>
					<small>Published on <time datetime="2021-69-69"><strong>April 5th, 2021</strong> by Fin Watling</time></small>

					<div>
						<p>
							When working with computers, one of the first most basic things you should learn is that naming your files properly is really important!
							if you want to be able to find your work in a hurry, this will be much easier with a clear and concise naming convention. For example,
							if you are working on an essay, you may want to name the document the essay title, or if you’re working on a spreadsheet, you’ll want the 
							title to give an overview of what the data represents.

					<div>
						<p>
							Many people do not consider the information they are giving to social media sites. Sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat take a lot
							 of data from users and sell it to 3rd parties. Most people dont realise they are giving this data to them and its vital that you check what you give them. 
							 Many sites are given this information by default and you must opt out. So please check those settings!
						</p>
						<p>
							As well as this, a lot of users information can be found publicly with ease. Most social media profiles are public and available for anyone to see. This is usually by default,
							once again making it very important to check your settings. Otherwise strangers who you dont know can easily see and use your information!

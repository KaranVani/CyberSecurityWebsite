							You may have heard of “cookies” and although they sound tasty, they’re nothing of the sort.
						 	Cookies are information stored in text files on your computer, they are usually used by websites to track your preferences.
						 	They can be an incredibly useful thing, for example allowing you to stay logged into your email account in your browser.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, cookies can store quite personal information about you, along with information about the device that you’re accessing the internet on.
							 The good thing is that these text files can’t be easily read by anyone outside the website that they’re for as they are encrypted. 
							 Unfortunately however, a lot of big companies such as Google share the cookies they collect with a multitude of other companies.
							  This is usually for marketing purposes, so that websites can personalize ads to target you.
							   This can make many users uncomfortable which is why some people choose not to enable cookies in their browser.

					<h2>Keeping Your Information Safe Online</h2>

						<p>
							It may sound obvious to some but it is important to remember that not everyone on the internet has good intentions.
							There are criminals on the internet that will pressure you into giving away your private information such as passwords and even sometimes your address.
							Giving in to these demands can cause you some serious grief, including having your money stolen or even having someone steal your identity!
						</p>
						<p>
							To prevent these thieves from stealing your information just stick to the simple rule;
							<strong>NEVER</strong> give sensitive information to somebody online without first verifying who they are and that the company they work for is legitimate.
							A lot of the time real companies will use authentication methods such as sending links to your phone or email to verify that they really are who they say they are,
							however if there are any doubts in your mind, don’t give away your information.

					<h2 class="titlez">Cookies And Why Some Choose To Disable Them</h2>
					<small>Published on <strong>February April 5th, 2020</strong> by Fin Watling</small>

						<p>	
							You may have heard of “cookies” and although they sound tasty, they’re nothing of the sort.
						 	Cookies are information stored in text files on your computer, they are usually used by websites to track your preferences.
						 	They can be an incredibly useful thing, for example allowing you to stay logged into your email account in your browser.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, cookies can store quite personal information about you, along with information about the device that you’re accessing the internet on.
							 The good thing is that these text files can’t be easily read by anyone outside the website that they’re for as they are encrypted. 
							 Unfortunately however, a lot of big companies such as Google share the cookies they collect with a multitude of other companies.
							  This is usually for marketing purposes, so that websites can personalize ads to target you.
							   This can make many users uncomfortable which is why some people choose not to enable cookies in their browser.

					<h2>Keeping Your Information Safe Online</h2> 
					<small>Published on <strong>May 5th, 2021</strong> by Fin Watling</small>

					<div>
						<p>
							It may sound obvious to some but it is important to remember that not everyone on the internet has good intentions.
							There are criminals on the internet that will pressure you into giving away your private information such as passwords and even sometimes your address.
							Giving in to these demands can cause you some serious grief, including having your money stolen or even having someone steal your identity!
						</p>
						<p>
							To prevent these thieves from stealing your information just stick to the simple rule;
							<strong>NEVER</strong> give sensitive information to somebody online without first verifying who they are and that the company they work for is legitimate.
							A lot of the time real companies will use authentication methods such as sending links to your phone or email to verify that they really are who they say they are,
							however if there are any doubts in your mind, don’t give away your information.

					<h2>Phishing_</h2>
					<small>Published on <strong>May 11th, 2021</strong> by Ben Edmondson</small>
					<div>
						<p>
							Phishing is a common form of social engineering. As explained in the previous post, you should never give sensitive information online without verifying the identity of someone.
							Phishers create a sense of urgency within text, emails, and other forms of online communication by warning a user of an intrusion or potential security risk. They will send you a link
							and ask you to change some information about your account. However, to do this you are required to log in. Their website will look exactly like the one you're used to but the password and 
							username you enter to be able to change will be stolen by them and used against you! Always be careful when clicking links online.
						</p>
						<p>
							To avoid troubles with phishing and other social engineering tricks that may be employed you should:
							<ul>
								<li>Avoiding opening links and emails from unrecognized sources.</li>
								<li>Using 2 factor authentication where possible.</li>
								<li>Understanding that not everyone on the internet is nice and some may try to steal from you.</li>
								<li>Keep your antivirus software up to date and scan for issues often.</li>
							</ul>

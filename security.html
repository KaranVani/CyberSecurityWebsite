					<h2 class="titlez" load-hidden>The Importance Of File Extensions</h2>
					<small>Published on <time datetime="2021-69-69"><strong>April 5th, 2021</strong> by Fin Watling</time></small>

					<div>
						<p>
							File extensions are the bit that comes after the file name, after the dot. 
							They tell Windows (or whatever operating system you use) the type of file that it is. For example,
							 .exe means executable, .zip means that it is a zipped or compressed file, .doc is a document file 
							 such as a microsoft word file and .png is a picture file.
						</p>
						<p>Aside from wanting to know what files are on your computer, there are some really important things to keep in mind to make sure you are secure on your PC.</p>
						<p>
							Executable files, or .exe files are files that when clicked, 
							complete a series of instructions one after the other, 
							this can be great if the file is an installer for something you want on your computer,
							 however, if the file is malicious but not detected by your antivirus, this type of file can be used to easily infect your computer with a virus.
							 The best way to keep safe from unwanted executables is to make sure you know what youâ€™re downloading online. Only download and run executable files
							  from well known websites and failing that, make sure that you scan the file using <strong>recently updated</strong> antivirus software.

					<h2>The Importance Of Using Strong Secure Passwords</h2> 
					<small>Published on <time datetime="2021-69-69"><strong>May 5th, 2021</strong></time></small>

					<div>
						<p>
							Using a strong password is really important in order to secure your accounts.
							Although it may seem unimportant to you right now, accounts you create in your early teens will most likely be used going into adulthood. 
							Email accounts are a good example of this. I still use an email account that I made when I was 12 years old.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the most important accounts to secure is your email account, as it can be linked to many of your other important accounts such as your bank accounts and social media accounts.
							For these reasons using a password that has upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols is really important.
